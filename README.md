# getGainz is an APP for trainers and athletes . 

Often, coaches and trainers will send their athletes an excel spreadsheet of some kind with the programme on it. As an aspiring athlete, each time i go for a workout, I want to be able to refer to my programme with ease. Currently, I need to go to my files on my phone and crank up the PDF that my coach has sent me. The PDF looks fine, but on my phone its too small so i need to zoom in to see the programme, and follow along like that. You could say it's not the most smooth user experience. I want to make something a bit smarter, a bit more intuitive. I want to be able to access the data easily, know what my next excerise is, how many reps and also what weight i should be doing based on my goals, and my progress. Essentially, the app will tell me what to do each workout based on the programme. It will be easy to track progress with the workout tracker. And maybe, even have a function for the coach to check in and view workout data from their side, maybe even get a notification when the athlete is working out! 



 The goal of this app is to convert or accept data to a programme that can be accessed and used from the athletes phone or tablet. It will also have the ability for the coach to create and edit programmes on behalf of the athlete as they track their progress. Ideally, the data of each workout can be stored to the users account, so graphs can be made given specific time frames such a 1 month, 3 months and 6 months, and all time.  Another feature would be to able to access any point in time and also what specific training programme was being implemented at the time.
